Micro Wardrobe
==============

## Inspiration

A small space always lacks on luxury things like an large corridor therefore you have to be creative to store your clothing. In my case only a small corner less than 2m per 0.6m in the corridor was left. Unfortunately there is no suitable solution on the market so I had to build it myself.

## Concept

I already bought a [METOD tall cabinet](http://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/10212563/#/90212559) (902.125.59) to sotre cleaning materials and mounted it on [CAPITA legs](http://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/30244346/) (302.443.46). Temporarily I used a hallstand to hang up the coats that looked always kind of messy.
