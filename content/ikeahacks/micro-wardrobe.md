Micro Wardrobe
==============

## Inspiration

A small space always lacks on luxury things like an large corridor therefore you have to be creative to store your clothing. In my case only a small corner less than 1.2m per 0.6m in the corridor was left. Unfortunately there is no suitable solution on the market so I had to build it myself.

## Concept

I already bought a [METHOD tall cabinet (902.125.59)](http://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/10212563/#/90212559) to store cleaning materials and mounted it on [CAPITA legs (302.443.46)](http://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/30244346/). Temporarily we used a hallstand to hang up the coats but that looked always kind of messy. That in mind a cloakroom rail was an obvious choice so I ordered a custom stainless steel pipe. The METHOD cabinet already consumes 40cm of the available 1.2m space so doing the math only 80cm are left. Fortunately the 4x4 KALLAX measures only 77cm per 77cm.

## Assembly

One important requirement was to easily assemble and disassemble the wardrobe. A lesson I learned from my previous Hacks is that it is nearly impossible to staple Ikea forniture with wood screws.
